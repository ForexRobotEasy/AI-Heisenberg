This code represents the AI Heisenberg Forex Robot, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The AI Heisenberg is a self-learning Forex software that aims to optimize trades by predicting market trends.

## Features

- Self-learning AI algorithm to predict market trends
- Dynamic trailing stop to adjust stop loss based on market conditions
- Buy or sell actions based on predicted market direction
- Adjustable take profit and stop loss ratios

## Usage

To use the AI Heisenberg Forex Robot, follow these steps:

1. Install and open the MetaTrader 5 platform.
2. Open a chart for the desired currency pair.
3. Attach the AI Heisenberg Forex Robot to the chart.
4. Set the desired lot size and magic number.
5. Monitor the trades and results on the platform.

## How it Works

The AI Heisenberg Forex Robot uses a self-learning AI algorithm to predict market trends. It constantly analyzes the market data and predicts the direction of the market (1 for buy, -1 for sell). 

On each tick, the Forex Robot checks for price reversals. If a reversal is detected and the predicted direction has changed, the Forex Robot takes action based on the new prediction. If the prediction is to buy, a buy order is placed with a stop loss and take profit calculated based on the current and previous prices. If the prediction is to sell, a sell order is placed with the corresponding stop loss and take profit.

The Forex Robot also adjusts the trailing stop based on the current price, allowing for dynamic stop loss adjustments based on market conditions.
